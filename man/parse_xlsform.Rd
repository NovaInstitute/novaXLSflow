\title{Parse an XLSForm file into a flowchart structure}
\usage{
parse_xlsform(filepath)
}
\arguments{
\item{xls_path}{A character string specifying the path to the XLSForm (XLSX) file.}
}
\value{
A list with two data frames: `nodes` and `edges`.
}
\description{
This function parses an XLSForm (XLSX file) and extracts a hierarchical structure of questions,
groups, and repeats. It also identifies logical relationships from `relevant`, `constraint`, and
`calculation` fields, producing a node-edge representation of the form logic.
}
\details{
The returned `nodes` data frame includes columns:
\itemize{
  \item \code{id}: The variable name of the question or group.
  \item \code{label}: The label text of the question or group (if available).
  \item \code{qtype}: The question type (e.g., "integer", "select_one", "begin_group").
}

The returned `edges` data frame includes columns:
\itemize{
  \item \code{from}: The ID of a node that influences the logic of another node.
  \item \code{to}: The ID of the node being influenced.
  \item \code{type}: The type of relationship ("hierarchy", "relevant", "constraint", "calculation").
  \item \code{condition}: The expression (e.g., relevance, constraint, calculation) associated with the edge.
}

\examples{
\dontrun{
  flowchart_data <- parse_xlsform("path/to/your_form.xlsx")
  str(flowchart_data)
